Prior to Feburary 2020, I was the Chief Scientist and the Director of Embedded System of [Bito Robotics, Inc.](https://www.bitorobotics.com/), which was co-foundered by Chaohui Gong, Howie Choset and Zhongqiang Ren and me, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in January 2017. 


I was graduated from [Boston University](www.bu.edu), under supervision of Professor [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/), who is currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and the director of the [Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. degree of Mechanical Engineering, focus on Dynamics, Robotics, Systems & Controls. I obtained a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2009, then I earned an M.S. degree in 2011 working within the HIT-DLR laboratory in Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology.


I am interested and expertized in embedded system, especially familiar with STM32 series of ARM micro-controllers. I am enthusiastic about robotics, I enjoy research in path planning and control of robotic system, and multi-robot systems. I am also interested in obstacle avoidance, computer vision and machine learning.
